Problem Statement:
We want to manage a zoo where different animals can be added to different enclosures. Some animals are of the same type, but each has a unique position (extrinsic state). Without the Flyweight Pattern, we'd have to store redundant information for each animal of the same type (e.g., same breed), which leads to memory inefficiency.

Using the Flyweight Pattern, we can have a shared intrinsic state for animals that belong to the same breed, while having unique extrinsic state for each animal, such as its position in the zoo.
