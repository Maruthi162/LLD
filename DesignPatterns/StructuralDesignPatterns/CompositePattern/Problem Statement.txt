ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement (File System Example):

    You are tasked with designing a system to represent a file structure, where:

    Files are individual items (like resume.pdf, photo.jpg).

    Folders (directories) can contain files and other folders.


The system should allow operations like:

    Displaying contents of a folder

    Getting total size

    Adding/removing files and subfolders

    Treating both files and folders uniformly
